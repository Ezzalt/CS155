//  Course: CS 155 - Computer Science
//  Semester: 5th Semester
//  Due Date: 29th August
//  Project 1 :
//  UNA football season is upon us. UNA will send 40% of its ticket receipts
//  to the City of Florence for the use of Braly Stadium. The stadium manager
//  has asked you to write a small program that will print an invoice for
//  weekly ticket income and profits for a given movie.Adult  tickets  sell
//  for  $8.25  and  children  tickets  are  $4.50.  The  program  will  ask
//  the  user  for  the name of the opponent, the number of adults tickets sold,
//  and the number of children tickets sold. Use a cstring to store the opponent
//  name.The program will compute the gross box office revenue, the City of
//  Florence amount, and UNAâ€™s net profit. It will then echo back the opponent
//  name along with the three computed values. It should display the amounts using
//  a dollar sign and two decimal places.
